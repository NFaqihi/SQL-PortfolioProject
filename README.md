# SQL-PortfolioProject
In this project, I looked at two datasets of COVID death information and COVID vaccination information.
These datasets were downloaded from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths (note: The website has updated the data since I got the data files).
These data files each have 85171 rows containing worldwide COVID data from February of 2020 to April of 2021.
This portfolio project demonstrates my skills in using various SQL queries including but not limited to JOIN, CTE, TEMPTABLE, SUBQUERY, PARTITION BY, ALIASING, AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS, etc.
